      of technology and the human experience, but really, it''s already happened.
      People are so attached to their phones, they are becoming a literal and physical
      expression of their inner selves. They take them everywhere, sleep, eat, talk
      and walk with them. Hold them close to their hearts. Even military guys get
      attached to their bomb-testing robots, asking to have their old one fixed instead
      of getting a new one. It''s a legitimate connection!'}
